# Setting project with kedro on .gitpod.yml

Create your new repo run it on gitpod.

Copy this repo 

close your workspace 

and run it again :) 

Also there is a issue with notebook on gitpod you need run it with remote access to work in it, if you want but you can use diffrent ipnyb IDEs :)

kedro jupyter lab --ServerApp.allow_remote_access=True
